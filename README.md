### What I learned

Open Icon with Span: For the first time, I created a navigation bar with an open icon using <span> elements. I implemented functionality to change the icon's position, and upon clicking it, the icon transforms into an "X" to indicate the menu's close state. This process helped me understand how to build interactive elements and manage their visual state effectively.

Horizontal Scrolling Menu: I learned how to create a horizontal scrolling menu using JavaScript. This involved disabling the default scroll behavior and adding custom scroll functionality to achieve smooth and user-friendly scrolling features.
