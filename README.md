# tbc-concept

This project is part of the selection process for the TBC IT Academy course. The task was to build a website similar to [www.tbcconcept.ge](https://tbcconcept.ge/ge). This project was designed to showcase skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to demonstrate the ability to create a responsive and visually appealing website.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Open Icon with Span: For the first time, I created a navigation bar with an open icon using <span> elements. I implemented functionality to change the icon's position, and upon clicking it, the icon transforms into an "X" to indicate the menu's close state. This process helped me understand how to build interactive elements and manage their visual state effectively.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp) - This link helped me create the responsive navigation bar. I found the tutorial very useful for understanding how to implement a responsive navigation menu and will use similar techniques in future projects.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLfBo4p9ANw&t=307s) - This video tutorial helped me create an animated menu icon. It was particularly useful in demonstrating the step-by-step process of designing and animating the icon, which I will apply in future projects.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_E5uoiLCLY) - This video tutorial helped me to create a horizontal scrolling menu, The tutorial provided clear instructions on how to design and implement the scrolling functionality, which significantly enhanced my understanding of creating interactive and user-friendly menu layouts.
